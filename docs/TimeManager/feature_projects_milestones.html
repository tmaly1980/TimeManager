Description:
</div>
<p style="text-indent: 10px">
  Task Groups and Milestones provide a way to organize tasks into relevent groups having a common goal. Grouping is arbitrary, and tasks can belong to multiple task groups. It helps you keep track of things on a broader scale than at the task level, while more refined than at the project level. Milestones are a special kind of task group that are tied to a specific project.
